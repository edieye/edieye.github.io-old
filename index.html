        <h1>Hi, I am Edie!</h1>
        <p id="box" class="lead">I am a recent BSc. graduate from University of British Columbia
          with a focus in computer science and am based in Vancouver, Canada.
          I began my career as an engineering intern at <a href="https://www.terramera.com/" style="color: #4CAF50">Terramera</a>
          in 2017
          and in 2018, I worked on <a href="http://docs.netapp.com/sgws-111/index.jsp" style="color: #4CAF50">Storagegrid 11.1</a>
          at <a href="https://www.netapp.com/us/index.aspx" style="color: #4CAF50">Netapp</a> and on

            Crystal Reports for Enterprise</a> at SAP Vancouver. I am an avid hiker and a huge fan of
            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/" style="color: #4CAF50">The Office.</a> My favourite character from
            The Office is <a href="https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Prison_Mike" style="color: #4CAF50">???</a> If you want
            to talk more about The Office, about any of my previous experiences, or have any general questions, feel free

        <div id="about" class="collapse lead">I am interested in a career as a developer because I enjoy problem solving.
          I believe software development is a space where I can continually challenge myself with problems and solutions
          that might not immediately present itself. Furthermore, I enjoy learning new concepts and love that we, as
          developers, have to constantly adapt to the growing and changing technologies around us. I believe it helps
          to keep the work we do interesting as it teaches us persistence and progression.
